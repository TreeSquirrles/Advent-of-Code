Some of this shit is actually so bad. 

They got me the right answer though.

Might redo some of them to be better. 

List of problems that are actually solved so badly:

2024 day 6 part 2. Could be optimized to not traverse so many squares. I have an algorithm in mind that actually only needs me to traverse the entire thing once. Although the proof is too big to fit in the margin  * fucking dies * (fermat moment)

2025 Day 2 Part 2. Not that it could be solved better, but I'd like to find a closed-form algorithm for finding repeated sequence numbers.
